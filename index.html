    <button class= "accordion">WHAT IS INTERSECTIONALITY?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>THE TERM "INTERSECTIONALITY", COINED BY KIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW, REFERS TO THE WAYS THAT AND INDIVIDUAL'S SOCIAL AND POLTICAL IDENTITIES CAN INTERSECT AND COMBINE TO PUT THEM AT AN ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE.</p>
          <p>THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONCEPT TO RECOGNIZE BECAUSE IT GIVES WAY FOR US TO RECOGNIZE OPPRESSION AND INJUSTICE THROUGH A MORE NUANCED WAY AS WE HONOR THE COMPLEXITIES AT PLAY REGARDING OUR IDENTITIES. THIS ALLOWS FOR A MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS AND ULTIMATELY, THE SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS.</p>

    <button class= "accordion" id="resources">RESTORATIVE JUSTICE</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IS AN APPROACH TO JUSTICE WHERE HEALING THE VICTIM IS THE PRIORITY RATHER THAN PUNISHING THE CRIMINAL. AND IT ALSO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE AMMENDS AND HELP BOTH SIDES BY MAKING SURE THE VICTIM'S PAIN IS TENDED TO BUT ALSO SEEING WHAT CAUSED THE CRIMINAL TO ACT THE WAY THEY DID SO WE CAN DO WHAT WE CAN TO PREVENT THEM FROM ACTING THAT WAY AGAIN.</p>
          <p>RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PLAYS A HUGE ROLE IN PUTTING INTERSECTIONALITY INTO PRAXIS; ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING HOW MANY MARGINALIZED INDIVIDUALS, SPECIFICALLY BLACK AMERICANS, ARE INCARCERATED IN AMERICA. THIS APPROACH TO JUSTICE ALLOWS US TO ANALYZE THE INJUSTICE THAT TAKES PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY THAT EVENTUALLY RESULTS IN CRIME AND PAIN. AND IT HELPS US TO PREVENT CRIME FROM HAPPENING BY FOCUSING ON THE WELL-BEING OF THE PEOPLE. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE INJUSTICES THAT TAKE PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY DO NOT OCCUR IN A MONOLITH, THEY ARE NUANCED AND COMPLEX SO THE NUANCED AND COMPLEX UNDERSTANDING OF INTERSECTIONALITY IS REQUIRED TO GRAPPLE WITH THEM.</p>

        <div class="panel">
          <p>THE STANDARDS THAT RULE OUR PERCEPTION OF BEAUTY HAVE BEEN BUILT UPON MUCH OTHERING AND MARGINALIZATION OF FEATURES AND QUALITIES THAT BELONG TO VARIOUS GROUPS OF PEOPLE. </p>
          <p>IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE WAY WE'VE BEEN SOCIALIZED TO PERCIEVE BEAUTY AND DO WHAT WE CAN TO UNLEARN OUR PREJUDICE RELATED TO DESIRABILITY BECAUSE THOSE PREJUDICES WILL INEVITABLY BLEED INTO OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR PERCEPTION.</p>

    <button class= "accordion" id="resources">HOMONATIONALISM</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>HOMONATIONALISM IS A NATIONALIST IDEOLOGY WHERE PEOPLE OR NATIONS WILL USE LGBTQ+ RIGHTS AS LEVERAGE AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR AND/OR IMMIGRANTS TO FURTHER SUPPORT THEIR RACISM AND XENOPHOBIA.</p>
          <p>THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONCEPT TO BE MADE AWARE AND START TO RECOGNIZE BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES TAKE PLACE ALL AROUND US. AND THIS ISSUE IS SO COMPLEX FOR MANY BECAUSE IT INVOLVES MULTIPLE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF MARGINALIZED PEOPLE WHO ARE ALL PLAYING VERY DIFFERENT, COMPLICATED ROLES WITHIN THIS PROBLEMATIC DYNAMIC.</p>

    <button class= "accordion" id="resources">CLASSISM</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>CLASSISM IS A BELIEF WHERE SOMEONE'S WEALTH AND STATUS DETERMINE THEIR WORTH. IT ALSO PROMOTES THE SOCIETAL FAVORMENT OF THE UPPER CLASS. AND SPECIFICALLY, NEOLIBERALISM IS A CLASSIST IDEOLOGY THAT REGURGITATES THE SAYING "PULL YOURSELF UP BY YOUR BOOTSTRAPS" AND ALMOST PLACES BLAME ON THE INDIVIDUAL FOR THEIR OWN ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCE RATHER THAN THE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS IT.</p>
          <p>THESE ARE BOTH IMPORTANT CONCEPTS TO UNDERSTAND IN ORDER TO PUT INTERSECTIONALITY INTO PRAXIS BECAUSE CLASS AND ECONOMICS ARE WHERE THE INJUSTICES OF OUR SOCIETY FULLY PLAY OUT. ONE'S IDENTITES HAS SO MUCH CORRELATION TO THEIR ECONOMIC STATUS AS WELL AS HOW THEY ARE TREATED FOR THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE.</p>
